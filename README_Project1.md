### CHD_Project1

### Project name : Advent of machine learning in predicting heart disease 

### Project description

The project is about predicting the occurrence of heart disease using machine learning models and data analytics. Machine learning may be used to diagnose, detect, and forecast many disorders in the medical industry. The primary purpose of this study is to give clinicians a tool to detect cardiac problems at 
an early stage. As a result, it will be easier to deliver appropriate treatment to patients while avoiding serious effects. Already, statistical methods are central in assessing cardiovascular disease risk and U.S. prevention guidelines. Developing predictive models gives health professionals’ actionable information by quantifying a patient’s risk and guiding the prescription of drugs or other preventive measures. Cardiovascular disease risk is typically computed using clinical information, 
such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, but rarely take social determinants, such as neighborhood-level factors, into account. 

I have used Python 3.6 for this project and some of the technical requirements to begin with this project would be Anaconda navigator, Jupyter notebook and at high level some of the libraries in Python we are planning to use are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, Logistic regression and KNN. I have started with Logistic regression initially as; logistic regression is the first choice for any binary classifier problems. Logistic regression is the statistical technique used to predict the relationship between predictors (our independent variables) and a predicted variable (the dependent variable) where the dependent variable is binary. Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis in statistics used for prediction of outcome of a categorical dependent variable from a set of predictors or independent variables. In logistic regression the dependent variable is always binary. Logistic regression is mainly used to for prediction and calculating the probability of success.

I have also used another model using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (KNN). KNN tries to find similarities between predictors and values that are within the dataset. It uses a non-parametric method as there is not a particular finding of parameters to a particular functional form. KNN is also called a lazy classifier as it memorizes the training data and not exactly learn and fix the weights. 

### Technologies used

1. Python 3.6
2. Jupyter notebook
3. pandas
4. matplotlib
5. numpy
6. seaborn
7. sklearn

### How to Install and Run the Project

Install anaconda navigator and jupyter notebook in the local machine, install and import all the mentioned libraries in the "Technologies used section".
Also, make sure you have the below dataset in the local machine.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression 

The dataset is publicly available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The 
classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Please download the dataset and import to your jupyter notebook and change the dataset location as per requirment. Once you have the dataset in place and all the required libraries imported, you can click run and the output should be available in few minutes.
