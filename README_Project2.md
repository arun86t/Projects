### Project2_AppStore

### Project name : Apple IOS App store Data Analysis 

### Project description

Most marketers and business owners can identify with the shift from web to apps based on their own mobile use. There is a trend for many users to consider an Apps Only world, this requires some adaption by businesses and investment in making your apps better and marketing them more. A big consideration is whether we market as a free, freemium, or paid app. While technically the paid market is not dead and can still produce reasonable success, users taste preferences are changing. Hybrid models of in-app purchases, in-app advertising, or even subscription models can be much more lucrative for publishers if they get it right.

The main problem I am trying to address is how app developers can take advantage of data analytics and improve app development, better advertisement, impression (The number of times the app has been viewed on the App Store), app Unit (The number of first-time app downloads made on the App Store), sales, higher downloads, and better profit. For app developers to achieve the above-mentioned attributes, we need to analyze the user reviews made by all the app users in apple IOS app store, apply ML algorithms, build model, and deploy.

There is a need for app store metrics because of the app store's rapid growth, with approximately 300,000 apps added each year. It is found that 75% of apps are free, 60% have no ratings, the Entertainment category has the worst user ratings, developers employ psychological pricing techniques, there is a correlation between price and rating, and a whole lot more. For any app developer the ratings their users provide via the store are of critical importance. They are the primary mechanism for receiving user feedback, and an app's rating, whether good or bad, will play a critical part in determining whether a user will download an app when it appears in search listings. Another very sensitive factor in determining the success of an app is its price, with the App Store allowing developers to either give their creations away for free, or sell it at competitive price. There are many metrics we can focus on to improve the performance, so it is important to define the KPIs and use those to identify which metrics should be in the focus. Some of them are Installs/Downloads, price, app retention, app churn and finally ratings, these are the KPI's that determine the success of app.

### How to Install and Run the Project

Install anaconda navigator and jupyter notebook in the local machine, install and import all the mentioned libraries in the "Technologies used section".
Also, make sure you have the below dataset in the local machine.

https://www.kaggle.com/code/avnishnish/analysis-of-apple-s-app-store/data 

The dataset has 2 sets of data and it is publicly available. This data set contains more than 7000 Apple iOS mobile application details. The data was extracted from the i-Tunes search API at the Apple Inc website. It includes over 7,000 records and 10+ attributes. Please download the dataset and import to your jupyter notebook and change the dataset location as per requirment. Once you have the dataset in place and all the required libraries imported, you can click run and the output should be available in few minutes.
